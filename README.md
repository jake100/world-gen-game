====

Java game made with slick2d that uses procedural world generation to generate the world.
The world generation code edits the world mostly by simulating turns.
There is a DayNightCycle, Points system, GameOver screen, save system, inventory/shop, menus etc...

Kill all the enemies to win the level, you have money that can be used to buy things from the shop that will be put into your inventory. There are weopons, villagers that earn you more money and structures to place.
The world is being constantly modified, by the enemies, foliage or your weopons.
